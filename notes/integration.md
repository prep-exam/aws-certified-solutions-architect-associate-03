### <span style="color:blue">Application Integration</span>

#### <span style="color:green">SQS (Amazon Simple Queue Service)</span>

- **Type:** Fully managed message queuing service
- **Specifications:**
  - **Standard Queue:**
    - Unlimited number of messages
    - Default retention period: 4 days, max: 14 days
    - Maximum message size: 256KB
    - Unlimited throughput and low latency (<10ms for publish and receive)
    - Potential for duplicate messages (At-least-once delivery)
    - Potential for out-of-order messages (best-effort ordering)
  
- **Operations:**
  - Messages are polled in batches (up to 10 messages) and deleted post-processing. Unprocessed messages remain in the queue and may be processed multiple times.
  - Producers and consumers must have permissions to send and receive messages (Queue Access Policy).
  - **Message Visibility Timeout:** When a message is being processed, it becomes invisible to other consumers for the timeout period.
  - **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** Stores messages that fail to process multiple times and exceed the maximum receives threshold.
  - **Temporary Queue Client:** Implement SQS Request-Response System.
  - **Message Delay:** Messages can be delayed up to 15 minutes. Set using Delivery Delay at the queue level or DelaySeconds parameter at the message level.
  - **Long Polling:** Reduces empty responses by setting ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds to a value greater than zero, allowing Amazon SQS to wait until a message is available.
  - **FIFO Queues:** Guarantees ordering and exactly-once processing with limited throughput (up to 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with batching). FIFO queue names must end with `.fifo`. Standard SQS cannot be converted to FIFO SQS.

- **Use Case:**
  - CloudWatch uses a custom metric to monitor `(SQS queue length / Number of EC2 instances)`, triggering ASG to auto scale EC2 instances based on the number of messages in the queue.

#### <span style="color:green">SNS (Amazon Simple Notification Service)</span>

- **Type:** Pub/Sub messaging service
- **Specifications:**
  - **Topics:** Up to 100,000 topics
  - **Subscriptions:** Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
  - **Subscribers:** Kinesis Data Firehose, SQS, HTTP, HTTPS, Lambda, Email, Email-JSON, SMS Messages, Mobile Notifications
  - **Subscription Filter Policy:** JSON policy for sending filtered messages to specific subscribers.

- **Patterns:**
  - **Fan-Out Pattern:** One SNS topic with multiple SQS subscribers. For example, send all order messages to an SNS topic and route filtered messages based on order status to three different application services using SQS.

#### <span style="color:green">Amazon MQ</span>

- **Type:** Managed message broker service
- **Specification:** Amazon-managed Apache ActiveMQ
- **Use Case:** Migrate existing message brokers using MQTT protocol to AWS.
